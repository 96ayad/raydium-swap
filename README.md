# Raydium Frontend App
A simple token swap frontend app to connect wallet and swap sol to ray. 

## Reminder
This project is an example project that's built for learning and sharing purpose only. As this project was developed in 2022, I believe that Raydium SDK has quite some significant upgrades and Raydium team should have provided developer guide. If you encounter any technical issue, it's best to contact Raydium's tech support for help.
